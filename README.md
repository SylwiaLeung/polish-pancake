HI!
My name is Sylwia and I decided to learn programming a few years back. Back in school and uni, I've always been kind of nerdy and analytical, but also curious. That's why I chose to learn chinese language in the first place.
I always wanted to have the kind of life that would let me learn, solve puzzles and explore non-stop - working in finances and accounting suited my skills but it felt like my brain stopped developing.
My primary reason for chosing IT is a friend of mine, who, back then, worked as a game dev, developing Leyers of Fear in C#. 
Thanks to him, I got really fascinated with the whole programming world and the idea that something that is in your head can come to life and be seen on the screen! Being able to manipulate data and creating "intelligence"!
The turning point, however, was seeing Mr. Robot series. The moment I saw Darlene coding stuff, I understood that being a girl does not desqualify me as a programmer.
At first, I wanted to learn C#, but somehow I got convinced that Python was a better choice for a noob like me. So I went to one of those programming schools and learned Python. It was fun, but learning C# remained my main objective.
Some time ago I decided I'd start learning it by myself, so I found some online courses at udemy.com and codecademy.com. However, it isn't as intuitive of a language as Python and I knew I'd better find someone to guide me through the process.

That's about it for me :) thanks for reading this!
